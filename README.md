This repository contains the implementation of several data structures written in TypeScript. The main intention is to help keep my mind sharp. I'm putting here the solutions to the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* and some other problems I judge interesting. Every problem has an associated test file associated to it.

To run it:

    npm install
    typings install
    npm test
