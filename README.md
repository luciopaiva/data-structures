# Data Structures

This repository contains the implementation of several data structures written in TypeScript. The main intention is to help keep my mind sharp. I'm putting here the solutions to the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* and some other problems I judge interesting. Every problem has an associated test file associated to it.

In case you run across this repository, feel free to take anything you want. These are all well-known algorithms, I'm not inventing anything new here :-)
